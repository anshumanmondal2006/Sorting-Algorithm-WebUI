## VISUALISE BASIC SORTING ALGORITHMS
A web-based project to **visualize popular sorting algorithms** like Bubble Sort, Selection Sort, Insertion Sort, and Quick Sort using interactive bars. Built with **HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and jQuery** ‚Äî ideal for learners to understand how sorting works step-by-step.

# PROJECT INFERENCE

1. Learned the important functions of `JQuery` and it's implementation to make the Website more functional and dynamic
2. Learned how to use the classes of `Bootstrap` to make the code responsive. The concept and the use of grid system became more crystal clear
3. The most important part is that, the use of delay function e.g setTimeout() helped me a lot to render the vizualization
4. I rely on HTML Structure `div` and Jquery for the animations and it worked well without `CANVAS`
5. Learned how to scrape the content inside the HTML Structure using Jquery inorder to get copied in the clipboard -->

# üöÄFUTURE IMPLEMENTATION AND IMPROVEMENTS TO BE DONE

1. Merging the entire `.js` script into a single file
2. Adding Merge Sort, Heap Sort, Radix Sort, etc.
3. A single window for visualization with multiple sorting options
4. Adding a stop  button to pause the visualisation
